Example 1:

```text
Input: [2, 1, 5, 2, 3, 2], S=7
Output: 2
Explanation: The smallest subarray with a sum greater than 
or equal to '7' is [5, 2].
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: [2, 1, 5, 2, 8], S=7
Output: 1
Explanation: The smallest subarray with a sum greater than 
or equal to '7' is [8].
```

Example 3:

```text
Input: [3, 4, 1, 1, 6], S=8
Output: 3
